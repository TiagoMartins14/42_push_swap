# 42_push_swap
Project developed during the Common Core @ 42 Porto

## Push_swap
Because Swap_push isn’t as natural

### Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.
